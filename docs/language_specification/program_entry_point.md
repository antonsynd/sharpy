# Program Entry Point

The entry point is either a file with top-level statements or a `main()` function:

```python
# Option 1: Top-level statements
print("Hello, World!")

# Option 2: main() function
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

**Note:** The Python idiom `if __name__ == "__main__":` does not exist in Sharpy.

*Implementation: 🔄 Lowered*
- *Top-level statements wrapped in generated `Main()` method*
- *Module code wrapped in `public static class Exports`*
